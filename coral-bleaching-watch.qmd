# Coral bleaching watch

Warmer temperatures stress coral and can lead to bleaching events.
Corals can recover from occasional bleaching events, but not when
they are too frequent, or the temperature 
goes too high or stays high too long.[^coral-bleaching-watch-6] "... ambient water temperatures as little as 1 to 2 °C
above a coral's tolerance level, indicated by summer monthly mean
temperatures, can cause coral bleaching".[^coral-bleaching-watch-1]

> First observed in the early 1980s, mass coral bleaching (whereby
> corals bleach over a wide area that can span tens, hundreds, or even
> thousands of kilometers) has become one of the most visible and
> damaging marine ecological impacts of persistently rising ocean
> temperatures. Bleaching is the process by which corals lose the
> symbiotic algae that give them their distinctive colors and main
> energy sources. If a coral is severely bleached, disease and death
> become likely. Severe coral bleaching has become more extensive,
> frequent, and intense. This can be seen in the acceleration of heat
> stress events that cause mass bleaching, and in new multi-decadal
> bleaching observation datasets. As manifested by the devastating
> 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event (now considered the longest,
> most widespread and most damaging coral bleaching event on record),
> mass bleaching events around the globe are often lasting many months;
> are becoming an annual event; and are impacting coral reefs that never
> bleached before. It's clear that remotely monitoring coral reefs and
> providing actionable intelligence are critical for early detection,
> on-the-ground response, communication, and enhancing coral reef
> resilience in a rapidly warming world.[^coral-bleaching-watch-2]

The NOAA Coral Reef Watch uses satellite remote sensing data to create 5
km resolution "virtual stations" to model sea surface temperature (SST)
and summarize the model in maps and gauges[^coral-bleaching-watch-3]. In this 
chapter I use the model output and bleaching alert levels with focus limited to Fiji.

[^coral-bleaching-watch-3]: See NOAA Coral Reef Watch map and
    introduction at <https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/vs/map.php> 

In summary: Fiji has not been spared the rising sea (and air) temperatures
seen globally, and the outlook for Fiji's corals seems to be getting worse. But 
it's not as bad as some other places.

For example, on 14 June 2024 the map of 7-day alert levels for the Pacific region^[The Daily Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring regional alerts are available at <https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index.php> ] shows an area between Fiji and Hawaii at AL4. The highest alert level Fiji experienced--ever--is AL2.

Linear regressions of daily max and min temperatures provide a useful way to characterize the decadal trends since 1985.

Air temperature is increasing as well, as noted in this Australian
Government report (note different start and end years than used above):

> Annual maximum and minimum temperatures have increased in both Suva
> (Figure 4) and Nadi since 1950. In Suva, maximum temperatures have
> increased at a rate of 0.15°C per decade and at Nadi Airport the rate
> of increase has been 0.18°C per decade. These temperature increases
> are consistent with the global pattern of
> warming.[^coral-bleaching-watch-4]

NOAA Coral Watch uses sea surface temperature (SST) as the
basis for determining normal temperatures and excessively warm periods.
See the reference below for details about the methodology.

> The CoralTemp SST provides a measurement of the nighttime ocean
> temperature at the sea surface, calibrated to 0.2 meters depth.
> Nighttime-only satellite SST observations are used to reduce the
> influence of daytime warming caused by solar heating at and near the
> sea surface and to avoid contamination from solar glare. Furthermore,
> at night, water temperatures at and near the sea surface are more
> vertically uniform. Compared with the daytime SST and blended
> day-night SST, the nighttime SST measurements provide more stable
> estimates of heat stress conducive to coral bleaching. The CoralTemp
> SST can be considered as a sea surface foundation temperature as
> described by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature
> (GHRSST).[^coral-bleaching-watch-5]
