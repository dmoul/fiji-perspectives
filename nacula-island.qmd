I stayed at Blue Lagoon Resort on Nacula island. I took the photo in @fig-nacula-spine from the spine of the island looking east. The tree in the foreground is a [pandanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandanus); the leaves are used throughout the South Pacific to make mats. The highest point is about 260 m (860 ft). The hills are mostly covered in dry grasses during August.

As shown in @fig-fiji-reefs-yasawas-nacula, Nacula is surrounded by a fringing reef. Seeing a reef from above the water doesn't do it justice (@fig-nacula-fringing-reef).

There is a gap in the reef right at the beach of Blue Lagoon Resort and Orsman Bay Resort (@fig-nacula-looking-over-blue-lagoon-resort). The snorkeling along the reef near shore was unusually good!

There were relaxing sunsets most evenings (@fig-nacula-relaxing-sunsets). Did you know that the sun seems to set faster near the equator?

I haven't mentioned the very good facilities, food, and service. That doesn't really fit here. See the many TripAdvisor reviews for details.
